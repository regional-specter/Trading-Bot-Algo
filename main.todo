       ☐ Baseline time-series logic for early pattern detection

     ☐ Layer 1 | Market State and Context Extraction
       ☐ Data normalisation and resampling functions
       ☐ Rolling statistics engine (returns, moving averages, variance, z-scores)
       ☐ Volatility measurement module (rolling std, ATR)
       ☐ Trend and momentum descriptors (direction, slope, strength)
       ☐ Lightweight market regime classifier (trending, ranging, volatile, quiet)

     ☐ Layer 2 | Signal and Edge Extraction
       ☐ Feature vector assembler from Layer 1 outputs
       ☐ Directional bias estimator (bullish, bearish, neutral)
       ☐ Confidence or probability estimator
       ☐ Expected payoff estimator (upside vs downside)
       ☐ Optional supervised learning models for edge estimation

     ☐ Layer 3 | Decision and Policy Layer
       ☐ State aggregator combining market, signal, and portfolio state
       ☐ Action selection policy (enter, exit, hold, scale)
       ☐ Position sizing logic based on confidence and volatility
       ☐ Timing preference logic (immediate vs delayed execution)
       ☐ Reinforcement learning agent or rule-based policy

     ☐ Layer 4 | Risk and Trade Management
       ☐ Position limit enforcement
       ☐ Entry validation and execution checks
       ☐ Stop-loss and take-profit logic
       ☐ Dynamic trade management and scaling
       ☐ Drawdown monitoring and kill-switch controls
